The metaclass workaround does not work for me. :/ I use pytest 6.2.4, python 3.7.9\n@radkujawa Nobody has been working on this so far, and 7.0 has been delayed for a long time (we haven't had a feature release this year yet!) for various reasons. Even if someone worked on this, it'd likely have to wait for 8.0 (at least in my eyes).\nRe workaround: The way the metaclass is declared needs to be ported from Python 2 to 3 for it to work. \n\nOn Fri, Jun 4, 2021, at 11:15, radkujawa wrote:\n> \n\n> And are there plans to include it to 7.0?
