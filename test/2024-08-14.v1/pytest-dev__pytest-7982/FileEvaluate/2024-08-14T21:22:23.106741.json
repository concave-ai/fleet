    "scratch_pad": "1. The issue reported is regarding symlinked directories not being collected since pytest 6.1.0. The main culprit is adding `follow_symlinks=False`, which prevents symlinks from being followed.\n\n2. Searching through the provided code in `pathlib.py`, there is a function `visit` which is used to walk directories recursively using `os.scandir`.\n\n3. In `visit`, `entry.is_dir(follow_symlinks=False)` is used, which aligns with the issue reported because `follow_symlinks` is explicitly set to `False` in directories traversal. This setting would cause the behavior described in the issue where symlinked directories are skipped.\n\n4. The `visit` function seems to be relevant to the issue because it is directly related to directory traversal behavior with symlinks.\n\n5. The rest of the functions and classes in the file are involved in managing paths, locks, and cleaning up directories but do not appear directly related to the specific issue of symlinked directories being skipped.\n\n6. Considering the context of the issue and the file content, `visit` with `follow_symlinks=False` is a likely root cause of the problem where symlinks are not followed.",
