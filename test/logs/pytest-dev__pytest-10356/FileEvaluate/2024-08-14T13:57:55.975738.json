    "scratch_pad": "The provided code handles the problem of merging pytest markers for classes when multiple inheritance is involved. From the issue description, it seems this behavior has been recognized as a bug in pytest because the expected markers from the base classes are not correctly propagated when using Python's MRO (Method Resolution Order). The relevant code in `src/_pytest/mark/structures.py` involves the management of marks associated with test classes and functions, but it does not appear to address or rectify the identified bug in regards to MRO and multiple inheritance, which may require additional modifications to ensure all markers are preserved and merged appropriately.\n\nThe main challenge lies in the current implementation, which does not properly collect and merge markers from all classes in the inheritance hierarchy. Thus, while the file provides necessary structures and functions for working with marks, it does not resolve the underlying issue raised in the bug report. Therefore, further evaluation or refactoring may need to be implemented in this file or related files to effectively address the identified behavior.",
