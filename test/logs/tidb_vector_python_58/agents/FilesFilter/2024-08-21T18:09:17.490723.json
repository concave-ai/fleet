It suggests that there is a problem with `sqlalchemy.engine` being `None`, which should not happen if it's supposed to represent a `sqlalchemy.engine.base.Connection` object.\n\nLet's consider relevant files based on keywords related to this problem:\n\n1. **`__del__`**: This is a core part of the issue, as the traceback explicitly references the `__del__` method and reports an AttributeError. The file `./tidb_vector/integrations/vector_client.py` is very likely relevant because it contains the `__del__` method implementation.\n\n2. **`TiDBVectorClient`**: The problem references the `TiDBVectorClient.__del__` method, implying that `vector_client.py` file, where the class is defined, might contain relevant code.\n\n3. **`sqlalchemy`**: Since the issue involves an unexpected NoneType where a `sqlalchemy` connection object is expected, files managing SQLAlchemy connections might help diagnose the problem. The file `./tidb_vector/integrations/vector_client.py` also appears under this keyword, confirming its relevance.\n\nConsidering these observations, the most pertinent file to check for this issue is `./tidb_vector/integrations/vector_client.py`. This file appears multiple times across keywords that directly relate to the problem context (e.g., `__del__`, `TiDBVectorClient`, `sqlalchemy`). Other files while containing references to related keywords such as `execute` and `integrations` are less directly related to the problem of an AttributeError originating from the `__del__` method.\n\nThus, the relevant file based on the problem description is:\n1. `./tidb_vector/integrations/vector_client.py`.",
