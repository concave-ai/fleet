Analyze the issue:\n   - The issue is about handling pytest markers in classes using multiple inheritance and ensuring markers are not lost due to MRO (Method Resolution Order).\n   - Key aspect: The behavior of pytest markers when inherited through multiple base classes. The suggestion involves modifying how markers are merged or handled when classes have multiple inheritance paths.\n\n2. Relevance of src/_pytest/compat.py:\n   - This file seems to contain compatibility utilities for pytest, dealing with differences between Python versions and providing utility functions like get_real_func, is_async_function, and others.\n   - The focus of this file is on compatibility and utility functions, not on the core logic related to pytest marking or MRO handling.\n   - No references to handling class markers or any mention of MRO in the context of pytest markers.\n\n3. Conclusion:\n   - The content of this file does not provide any indication that it deals with the issue of pytest markers and multiple inheritance.\n   - This file is more about ensuring compatibility across Python versions for general functionality and not about the specific issue of marker inheritance.\n   - This file is not directly relevant to the issue at hand. Further investigation should focus on areas of the codebase where marker handling is implemented, possibly in files dealing with test collection or execution logic in pytest.",
