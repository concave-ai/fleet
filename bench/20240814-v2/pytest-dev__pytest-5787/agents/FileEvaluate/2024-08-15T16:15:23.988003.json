    "scratch_pad": "The reported issue is about improving the serialization of chained exceptions in pytest, particularly when running tests with pytest-xdist. The expected behavior is that when a chained exception occurs, all related exceptions, including those leading up to the final one, are displayed, not just the last one.\n\nLooking through the provided file `src/_pytest/python_api.py`, the context manager `RaisesContext` and the function `raises()` in particular are crucial for managing exceptions in pytest. These are responsible for catching and inspecting exceptions and are highly relevant because they determine the exception handling and reporting mechanism in pytest.\n\n1. **RaisesContext**: This class has methods to manage exception entering and exiting, and it holds exception information (`self.excinfo`). It will need to be adjusted to capture and serialize chained exceptions entirely because the specific issue is within how exceptions are reported, especially with nested exceptions.\n\n2. **raises()**: This function is integral to capturing exceptions and has mechanisms to check expected exceptions. Any change in how exceptions are serialized or reported will likely involve this method because it interacts with exceptions and controls how they are processed in pytest.\n\nThe above symbols relate directly to the handling of exceptions within pytest and could potentially manage the serialization of chained exceptions, as the problem suggests exceptions are not being serialized fully (missing chained exceptions when tests are run with pytest-xdist).\n\n**Relevance Decision:** The file is relevant, but it may not be the root cause by itself due to the fact that the actual serialization might be distributed across multiple modules or depends on configurations with pytest-xdist. However, this file contains core components handling exceptions within pytest that likely play a significant role in the issue.",

One way to\n    deal with this problem is to assert that two floating-point numbers are\n    equal to within some appropriate tolerance::\n\n        >>> abs((0.1 + 0.2) - 0.3) < 1e-6\n        True\n\n    However, comparisons like this are tedious to write and difficult to\n    understand.  Furthermore, absolute comparisons like the one above are\n    usually discouraged because there's no tolerance that works well for all\n    situations.  ``1e-6`` is good for numbers around ``1``, but too small for\n    very big numbers and too big for very small ones.  It's better to express\n    the tolerance as a fraction of the expected value, but relative comparisons\n    like that are even more difficult to write correctly and concisely.\n\n    The ``approx`` class performs floating-point comparisons using a syntax\n    that's as intuitive as possible::\n\n        >>> from pytest import approx\n        >>> 0.1 + 0.2 == approx(0.3)\n        True\n\n    The same syntax also works for sequences of numbers::\n\n        >>> (0.1 + 0.2, 0.2 + 0.4) == approx((0.3, 0.6))\n        True\n\n    Dictionary *values*::\n\n        >>> {'a': 0.1 + 0.2, 'b': 0.2 + 0.4} == approx({'a': 0.3, 'b': 0.6})\n        True\n\n    ``numpy`` arrays::\n\n        >>> import numpy as np                                                          # doctest: +SKIP\n        >>> np.array([0.1, 0.2]) + np.array([0.2, 0.4]) == approx(np.array([0.3, 0.6])) # doctest: +SKIP\n        True\n\n    And for a ``numpy`` array against a scalar::\n\n        >>> import numpy as np                                         # doctest: +SKIP\n        >>> np.array([0.1, 0.2]) + np.array([0.2, 0.1]) == approx(0.3) # doctest: +SKIP\n        True\n\n    By default, ``approx`` considers numbers within a relative tolerance of\n    ``1e-6`` (i.e. one part in a million) of its expected value to be equal.\n    This treatment would lead to surprising results if the expected value was\n    ``0.0``, because nothing but ``0.0`` itself is relatively close to ``0.0``.\n    To handle this case less surprisingly, ``approx`` also considers numbers\n    within an absolute tolerance of ``1e-12`` of its expected value to be\n    equal.  Infinity and NaN are special cases.  Infinity is only considered\n    equal to itself, regardless of the relative tolerance.  NaN is not\n    considered equal to anything by default, but you can make it be equal to\n    itself by setting the ``nan_ok`` argument to True.  (This is meant to\n    facilitate comparing arrays that use NaN to mean \"no data\".)\n\n    Both the relative and absolute tolerances can be changed by passing\n    arguments to the ``approx`` constructor::\n\n        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1)\n        False\n        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1, rel=1e-3)\n        True\n        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1, abs=1e-3)\n        True\n\n    If you specify ``abs`` but not ``rel``, the comparison will not consider\n    the relative tolerance at all.  In other words, two numbers that are within\n    the default relative tolerance of ``1e-6`` will still be considered unequal\n    if they exceed the specified absolute tolerance.  If you specify both\n    ``abs`` and ``rel``, the numbers will be considered equal if either\n    tolerance is met::\n\n        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1)\n        True\n        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1, abs=1e-12)\n        False\n        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1, rel=1e-6, abs=1e-12)\n        True\n\n    If you're thinking about using ``approx``, then you might want to know how\n    it compares to other good ways of comparing floating-point numbers.  All of\n    these algorithms are based on relative and absolute tolerances and should\n    agree for the most part, but they do have meaningful differences:\n\n    - ``math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=0.0)``:  True if the relative\n      tolerance is met w.r.t. either ``a`` or ``b`` or if the absolute\n      tolerance is met.  Because the relative tolerance is calculated w.r.t.\n      both ``a`` and ``b``, this test is symmetric (i.e.  neither ``a`` nor\n      ``b`` is a \"reference value\").  You have to specify an absolute tolerance\n      if you want to compare to ``0.0`` because there is no tolerance by\n      default.

Because the relative tolerance\n      is only calculated w.r.t. ``b``, this test is asymmetric and you can\n      think of ``b`` as the reference value.

No relative tolerance is\n      considered and the absolute tolerance cannot be changed, so this function\n      is not appropriate for very large or very small numbers.  Also, it's only\n      available in subclasses of ``unittest.TestCase`` and it's ugly because it\n      doesn't follow PEP8.  `More information...`__\n\n      __ https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual\n\n    - ``a == pytest.approx(b, rel=1e-6, abs=1e-12)``: True if the relative\n      tolerance is met w.r.t. ``b`` or if the absolute tolerance is met.\n      Because the relative tolerance is only calculated w.r.t. ``b``, this test\n      is asymmetric and you can think of ``b`` as the reference value.  In the\n      special case that you explicitly specify an absolute tolerance but not a\n      relative tolerance, only the absolute tolerance is considered.\n\n    .. warning::\n\n       .. versionchanged:: 3.2\n\n       In order to avoid inconsistent behavior, ``TypeError`` is\n       raised for ``>``, ``>=``, ``<`` and ``<=`` comparisons.\n       The example below illustrates the problem::\n\n           assert approx(0.1) > 0.1 + 1e-10  # calls approx(0.1).__gt__(0.1 + 1e-10)\n           assert 0.1 + 1e-10 > approx(0.1)  # calls approx(0.1).__lt__(0.1 + 1e-10)\n\n       In the second example one expects ``approx(0.1).__le__(0.1 + 1e-10)``\n       to be called.

To match a literal\n        string that may contain `special characters`__, the pattern can\n        first be escaped with ``re.escape``.\n\n        __ https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax\n\n\n    .. currentmodule:: _pytest._code\n\n    Use ``pytest.raises`` as a context manager, which will capture the exception of the given\n    type::\n\n        >>> with raises(ZeroDivisionError):\n        ...    1/0\n\n    If the code block does not raise the expected exception (``ZeroDivisionError`` in the example\n    above), or no exception at all, the check will fail instead.\n\n    You can also use the keyword argument ``match`` to assert that the\n    exception matches a text or regex::\n\n        >>> with raises(ValueError, match='must be 0 or None'):\n        ...     raise ValueError(\"value must be 0 or None\")\n\n        >>> with raises(ValueError, match=r'must be \\d+$'):\n        ...     raise ValueError(\"value must be 42\")\n\n    The context manager produces an :class:`ExceptionInfo` object which can be used to inspect the\n    details of the captured exception::\n\n        >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n        ...     raise ValueError(\"value must be 42\")\n        >>> assert exc_info.type is ValueError\n        >>> assert exc_info.value.args[0] == \"value must be 42\"\n\n    .. deprecated:: 4.1\n\n        In the context manager form you may use the keyword argument\n        ``message`` to specify a custom failure message that will be displayed\n        in case the ``pytest.raises`` check fails. This has been deprecated as it\n        is considered error prone as users often mean to use ``match`` instead.\n        See :ref:`the deprecation docs <raises message deprecated>` for a workaround.\n\n    .. note::\n\n       When using ``pytest.raises`` as a context manager, it's worthwhile to\n       note that normal context manager rules apply and that the exception\n       raised *must* be the final line in the scope of the context manager.\n       Lines of code after that, within the scope of the context manager will\n       not be executed. For example::\n\n           >>> value = 15\n           >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n           ...     if value > 10:\n           ...         raise ValueError(\"value must be <= 10\")\n           ...     assert exc_info.type is ValueError  # this will not execute\n\n       Instead, the following approach must be taken (note the difference in\n       scope)::\n\n           >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n           ...     if value > 10:\n           ...         raise ValueError(\"value must be <= 10\")\n           ...\n           >>> assert exc_info.type is ValueError\n\n    **Using with** ``pytest.mark.parametrize``\n\n    When using :ref:`pytest.mark.parametrize ref`\n    it is possible to parametrize tests such that\n    some runs raise an exception and others do not.\n\n    See :ref:`parametrizing_conditional_raising` for an example.\n\n    **Legacy form**\n\n    It is possible to specify a callable by passing a to-be-called lambda::\n\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, lambda: 1/0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n\n    or you can specify an arbitrary callable with arguments::\n\n        >>> def f(x): return 1/x\n        ...\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, f, 0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, f, x=0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n\n    The form above is fully supported but discouraged for new code because the\n    context manager form is regarded as more readable and less error-prone.\n\n    .. note::\n        Similar to caught exception objects in Python, explicitly clearing\n        local references to returned ``ExceptionInfo`` objects can\n        help the Python interpreter speed up its garbage collection.\n\n        Clearing those references breaks a reference cycle\n        (``ExceptionInfo`` --> caught exception --> frame stack raising\n        the exception --> current frame stack --> local variables -->\n        ``ExceptionInfo``) which makes Python keep all objects referenced\n        from that cycle (including all local variables in the current\n        frame) alive until the next cyclic garbage collection run.
