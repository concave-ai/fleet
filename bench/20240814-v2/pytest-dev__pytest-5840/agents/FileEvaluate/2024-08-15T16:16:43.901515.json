    "scratch_pad": "### Reported Issue Analysis\nThe issue report indicates a problem with the pytest version 5.1.2 where paths are being converted to lowercase on Windows, causing an ImportError. The error message suggests that the system is looking for a module in a path that does not exist due to case sensitivity issues.\n\n### File Content Analysis\nLooking into the `src/_pytest/pathlib.py` file, it contains utility functions dealing with path operations. Several functions seem relevant to the issue at hand:\n\n1. **find_prefixed(root, prefix):** - This function finds all elements in a root directory that starts with a given prefix, ignoring case sensitivity. This can relate to the issue of paths being converted to lowercase.\n\n2. **find_suffixes(root, prefix):** - It uses `find_prefixed` and might also be involved in case normalization or processing of paths.\n\n3. **unique_path(path):** - This function attempts to return a unique path accounting for case-insensitivity, which might be directly linked to the reported issue. The normalization of path case seems directly related to the problem of the entire path being converted to lowercase.\n\nConsidering these functions' operations, particularly `unique_path` which mentions case-insensitive filesystems like Windows, it's likely that this file is responsible for handling paths and could lead to the problem reported. \n\nHowever, without additional information about changes between pytest versions 5.1.1 and 5.1.2 in this specific file, identifying a root cause conclusively is challenging.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe relevant functions 'find_prefixed', 'find_suffixes', and 'unique_path' suggest that this file could be involved in causing the issue by handling path cases differently, potentially leading to the ImportError related to case sensitivity on Windows.",
