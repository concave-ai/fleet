    "scratch_pad": "The issue at hand is related to Pytest crashing the Python interpreter. The error occurs during the compilation of expressions with certain keywords \"None\", \"True\", and \"False\" leading to a failed assertion.\n\nIn the file `src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py`, several functions and classes deal with expressions and parsing logic, particularly with options like '-k' and '-m'. These involve expression compilation and evaluation using the `Expression` class imported from `expression` module.\n\n1. **Functions of Interest**:\n   - `deselect_by_keyword()` and `deselect_by_mark()` both use `Expression.compile()`, which directly correlates with the issue description where `Expression.compile(\"False\")` was mentioned.\n   - The `pytest_addoption()` function defines command-line options which use keyword and mark expressions. This might indirectly contribute by enabling such expressions.\n\n2. **Classes of Interest**:\n   - `KeywordMatcher` and `MarkMatcher`, as they deal with expression matching which involves `Expression.compile()`.\n\n3. **Imports of Interest**:\n   - `Expression` from `.expression`: Since the issue mentioned involves compiling an expression, it's important to determine how this class or method operates in relation to mark handling in pytest.\n\nThe file seems relevant because it uses the `compile` method of the `Expression` class which is tied to the issue, but does not contain the root cause as it primarily deals with orchestration via a function or method call. \n\nIt's likely that the problem lies in the implementation of `Expression` itself, which this file imports and assumes proper behavior from.\n\nTherefore, this file contains relevant code that likely contributes to the process where the issue manifests but is not the root cause.",
