    "scratch_pad": "### Step 1: Analyze User Instructions\n\n1.1 Understanding the Issue:\n- The user reports a discrepancy in how exceptions are captured using a standard Python try-except block versus using the `pytest.raises` context manager.\n- Specifically, the `str()` representation of the context manager `pytest.raises(LookupError) as e` outputs differently compared to using a standard `except LookupError as e` block. The wrapped context manager requires `str(e.value)` to retrieve the full message.\n\n1.2 User provide reproduction steps:\n- Code examples are clear and show the difference in output when using `try-except` and `pytest.raises`.\n\n1.3 Problem Analysis:\n- The discrepancy arises because `pytest.raises` uses an internal class/architecture to capture exceptions, not directly yielding the exception object but wrapped context.\n- The context variable in `pytest.raises` holds an `ExceptionInfo` object, not the exception itself, hence `e.value` is required to access the exception details.\n\n1.4 User Expectation:\n- Users might expect `pytest.raises` to behave similarly to a normal `try-except` block regarding exception handling for consistency and ease of use.\n- Users do not find having to explicitly access `.value` intuitive and it's considered a gotcha.\n\n1.5 Cause of the Issue:\n- The design difference in `pytest` where it uses its `ExceptionInfo` structure inside its raises context manager.\n\n1.6 Possible Solutions:\n- Wrap the `ExceptionInfo` such that when accessing as string, it defaults to `str(e.value)` internally or document this prominently to inform users of the behavior.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Presented File\n\n2.1 Analyzing `python_api.py`\n- The file contains the function `raises` that defines the context manager behavior.\n- There is mention of `ExceptionInfo`, which is pivotal since it is the core of the discrepancy observed.\n\n2.2 Match Symbols or Context\n- The `RaisesContext` class with its `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods are the key symbols. They handle the setup and teardown of the `pytest.raises` context.\n- The `ExceptionInfo` object accessed by `self.excinfo` is directly involved in how exceptions are encapsulated and stringified.\n\n- Several checks in `__exit__` and handling of `self.excinfo` could be adjusted to change string behavior.\n\n2.3 Relevance of the File\n- The file is relevant as it defines the `RaisesContext` and thus the behavior seen in `pytest.raises`.\n\n2.4 Root Cause Determination\n- The issue directly stems from how `RaisesContext.__enter__` and `.__exit__` assigns and retrieves debugging info, primarily responsible for handling exceptions differently, which is the core difficulty users face when expecting typical Python behavior.\n\n2.5 Referenced Code\n- Inside the `raises` function, it creates and returns instances of `RaisesContext`, responsible for deviation, suggesting the root cause lies within handling or documentation of `self.excinfo`.\n\nConclusively, the patterns reviewed primarily indicate necessity for improved documentation or modification in `__str__` conversion.",

One way to\n    deal with this problem is to assert that two floating-point numbers are\n    equal to within some appropriate tolerance::\n\n        >>> abs((0.1 + 0.2) - 0.3) < 1e-6\n        True\n\n    However, comparisons like this are tedious to write and difficult to\n    understand.  Furthermore, absolute comparisons like the one above are\n    usually discouraged because there's no tolerance that works well for all\n    situations.  ``1e-6`` is good for numbers around ``1``, but too small for\n    very big numbers and too big for very small ones.  It's better to express\n    the tolerance as a fraction of the expected value, but relative comparisons\n    like that are even more difficult to write correctly and concisely.\n\n    The ``approx`` class performs floating-point comparisons using a syntax\n    that's as intuitive as possible::\n\n        >>> from pytest import approx\n        >>> 0.1 + 0.2 == approx(0.3)\n        True\n\n    The same syntax also works for sequences of numbers::\n\n        >>> (0.1 + 0.2, 0.2 + 0.4) == approx((0.3, 0.6))\n        True\n\n    Dictionary *values*::\n\n        >>> {'a': 0.1 + 0.2, 'b': 0.2 + 0.4} == approx({'a': 0.3, 'b': 0.6})\n        True\n\n    ``numpy`` arrays::\n\n        >>> import numpy as np                                                          # doctest: +SKIP\n        >>> np.array([0.1, 0.2]) + np.array([0.2, 0.4]) == approx(np.array([0.3, 0.6])) # doctest: +SKIP\n        True\n\n    And for a ``numpy`` array against a scalar::\n\n        >>> import numpy as np                                         # doctest: +SKIP\n        >>> np.array([0.1, 0.2]) + np.array([0.2, 0.1]) == approx(0.3) # doctest: +SKIP\n        True\n\n    By default, ``approx`` considers numbers within a relative tolerance of\n    ``1e-6`` (i.e. one part in a million) of its expected value to be equal.\n    This treatment would lead to surprising results if the expected value was\n    ``0.0``, because nothing but ``0.0`` itself is relatively close to ``0.0``.\n    To handle this case less surprisingly, ``approx`` also considers numbers\n    within an absolute tolerance of ``1e-12`` of its expected value to be\n    equal.  Infinity and NaN are special cases.  Infinity is only considered\n    equal to itself, regardless of the relative tolerance.  NaN is not\n    considered equal to anything by default, but you can make it be equal to\n    itself by setting the ``nan_ok`` argument to True.  (This is meant to\n    facilitate comparing arrays that use NaN to mean \"no data\".)\n\n    Both the relative and absolute tolerances can be changed by passing\n    arguments to the ``approx`` constructor::\n\n        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1)\n        False\n        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1, rel=1e-3)\n        True\n        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1, abs=1e-3)\n        True\n\n    If you specify ``abs`` but not ``rel``, the comparison will not consider\n    the relative tolerance at all.  In other words, two numbers that are within\n    the default relative tolerance of ``1e-6`` will still be considered unequal\n    if they exceed the specified absolute tolerance.  If you specify both\n    ``abs`` and ``rel``, the numbers will be considered equal if either\n    tolerance is met::\n\n        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1)\n        True\n        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1, abs=1e-12)\n        False\n        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1, rel=1e-6, abs=1e-12)\n        True\n\n    If you're thinking about using ``approx``, then you might want to know how\n    it compares to other good ways of comparing floating-point numbers.  All of\n    these algorithms are based on relative and absolute tolerances and should\n    agree for the most part, but they do have meaningful differences:\n\n    - ``math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=0.0)``:  True if the relative\n      tolerance is met w.r.t. either ``a`` or ``b`` or if the absolute\n      tolerance is met.  Because the relative tolerance is calculated w.r.t.\n      both ``a`` and ``b``, this test is symmetric (i.e.  neither ``a`` nor\n      ``b`` is a \"reference value\").  You have to specify an absolute tolerance\n      if you want to compare to ``0.0`` because there is no tolerance by\n      default.

Because the relative tolerance\n      is only calculated w.r.t. ``b``, this test is asymmetric and you can\n      think of ``b`` as the reference value.

No relative tolerance is\n      considered and the absolute tolerance cannot be changed, so this function\n      is not appropriate for very large or very small numbers.  Also, it's only\n      available in subclasses of ``unittest.TestCase`` and it's ugly because it\n      doesn't follow PEP8.  `More information...`__\n\n      __ https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual\n\n    - ``a == pytest.approx(b, rel=1e-6, abs=1e-12)``: True if the relative\n      tolerance is met w.r.t. ``b`` or if the absolute tolerance is met.\n      Because the relative tolerance is only calculated w.r.t. ``b``, this test\n      is asymmetric and you can think of ``b`` as the reference value.  In the\n      special case that you explicitly specify an absolute tolerance but not a\n      relative tolerance, only the absolute tolerance is considered.\n\n    .. warning::\n\n       .. versionchanged:: 3.2\n\n       In order to avoid inconsistent behavior, ``TypeError`` is\n       raised for ``>``, ``>=``, ``<`` and ``<=`` comparisons.\n       The example below illustrates the problem::\n\n           assert approx(0.1) > 0.1 + 1e-10  # calls approx(0.1).__gt__(0.1 + 1e-10)\n           assert 0.1 + 1e-10 > approx(0.1)  # calls approx(0.1).__lt__(0.1 + 1e-10)\n\n       In the second example one expects ``approx(0.1).__le__(0.1 + 1e-10)``\n       to be called.

For example::\n\n           >>> value = 15\n           >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n           ...     if value > 10:\n           ...         raise ValueError(\"value must be <= 10\")\n           ...     assert exc_info.type is ValueError  # this will not execute\n\n       Instead, the following approach must be taken (note the difference in\n       scope)::\n\n           >>> with raises(ValueError) as exc_info:\n           ...     if value > 10:\n           ...         raise ValueError(\"value must be <= 10\")\n           ...\n           >>> assert exc_info.type is ValueError\n\n    **Using with** ``pytest.mark.parametrize``\n\n    When using :ref:`pytest.mark.parametrize ref`\n    it is possible to parametrize tests such that\n    some runs raise an exception and others do not.\n\n    See :ref:`parametrizing_conditional_raising` for an example.\n\n    **Legacy form**\n\n    It is possible to specify a callable by passing a to-be-called lambda::\n\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, lambda: 1/0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n\n    or you can specify an arbitrary callable with arguments::\n\n        >>> def f(x): return 1/x\n        ...\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, f, 0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n        >>> raises(ZeroDivisionError, f, x=0)\n        <ExceptionInfo ...>\n\n    The form above is fully supported but discouraged for new code because the\n    context manager form is regarded as more readable and less error-prone.\n\n    .. note::\n        Similar to caught exception objects in Python, explicitly clearing\n        local references to returned ``ExceptionInfo`` objects can\n        help the Python interpreter speed up its garbage collection.\n\n        Clearing those references breaks a reference cycle\n        (``ExceptionInfo`` --> caught exception --> frame stack raising\n        the exception --> current frame stack --> local variables -->\n        ``ExceptionInfo``) which makes Python keep all objects referenced\n        from that cycle (including all local variables in the current\n        frame) alive until the next cyclic garbage collection run.
