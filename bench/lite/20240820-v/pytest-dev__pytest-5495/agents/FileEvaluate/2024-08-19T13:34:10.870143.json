    "scratch_pad": "### Analyzing the Reported Issue\nThe reported issue concerns the assertion rewriting message in pytest when dealing with byte string comparisons. The error message produced is somewhat misleading because it gives the ASCII ordinal of the first differing character, which is not immediately clear to the user. Instead of understanding the byte string representation and its differences, it quickly shows the ASCII value of the mismatched characters, such as 52 for \"4\" and 49 for \"1\".\n\n1.1 The user experiences confusion when asserting byte strings with pytest, specifically when the byte string does not match expected values.\n1.2 The user illustrates their concern using a test code snippet that asserts two byte strings against each other, highlighting the difference in the error message produced.\n1.3 The issue seems to arise from how pytest reformats and reports assertion failures for byte strings using under-the-hood assertion rewriting logic.\n1.4 The expectation is a clearer message explaining the logical rationale of the byte string comparison instead of an ASCII representation.\n1.5 The confusion stems primarily from the interpretation of differences as ASCII ordinals.\n1.6 Suggestions for solutions:\n- Modify error message to display hexadecimal or escaped characters rather than ASCII ordinals.\n- Provide explicit bytes difference in output.\n\n### Evaluating the File Content\nThe file `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` deals mainly with assertion rewriting, which is highly relevant to the reported issue.\n\n2.1 The file rewrites assertions for detailed messages, which aligns with the user's confusion about assertion outputs.\n2.2 The class `AssertionRewriter` along with its method `visit_Compare` is central to the handling and rewriting of assert comparisons, potentially including byte strings.\n2.3 The method `_call_reprcompare` is responsible for invoking a custom comparison over assertion expressions, which might contribute to generating confusing messages.\n2.4 The method `rewrite_asserts` is used to rewrite assert statements containing explanation about variable differences. \n2.5 Methods like `_saferepr` may contribute to the representation logic of different types including bytes, which can influence message output.\n2.6 This file likely isn't the sole root cause but a part of how assertion messages get formatted and rewritten. However, it plays a significant role in translating assertions, thus carrying potential for adjusting message clarity.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe file `rewrite.py` is indeed relevant because it hosts code responsible for transforming assertions into more informative messages, including via `AssertionRewriter`. Specifically, the handling of comparative asserts, operation maps, and representation formats align with where changes would make sense for improving clarity on byte string comparisons.",
