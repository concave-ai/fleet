Specifically, the error messages generated when assertions fail do not provide enough information to diagnose which element in the iterable caused the failure.\n   1.2. The user mentions different ways they tried to assert conditions across an iterable: using a generator expression, a list comprehension, and a for loop. The for loop provides a more useful error message but is less concise.\n   1.3. The root cause is likely due to how `all()` and `any()` work\u2014they do not provide detailed failure context since they return a boolean after evaluating the entire iterable.\n   1.4. The user expects a more detailed failure report, similar to what happens in a for loop where the exact element causing an assertion failure is shown.\n   1.5. A possible solution is to modify or create a custom assertion function that mimics `all()` or `any()` but provides more informative error messages by unrolling the iterations and checking each element.\n\n2. Evaluating the Provided File:\n   2.1 The file `src/_pytest/assertion/__init__.py` appears to deal with assertion mechanism setup and may not directly influence how `all()` or `any()` failure messages are generated.\n   2.2 Key areas like `pytest_addoption`, `register_assert_rewrite`, `AssertionState`, and related functions deal with assertion rewriting and not directly with modifying how assertions are reported.\n   2.3 The functions seem related to configuring pytest's behavior, particularly regarding how assertions are checked and reported.\n   2.4 No function specifically handles the unrolling of iterables inside assertions or providing detailed feedback on `all()` or `any()` calls.\n   2.5 The closest related area might be the configuration of custom assertion hooks in `pytest_runtest_setup`. However, this is likely too high-level to affect individual `all()` or `any()` calls directly.",
