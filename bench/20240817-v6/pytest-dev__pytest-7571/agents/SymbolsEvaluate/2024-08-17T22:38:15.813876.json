  "issue": "<description>:caplog fixture doesn't restore log level after test\nFrom the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.0/logging.html#caplog-fixture, \"The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test\".\r\nIt used to work, but looks broken in new 6.0 release. Minimal example to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef test_foo(caplog):\r\n    caplog.set_level(42)\r\n\r\ndef test_bar(caplog):\r\n    print(caplog.handler.level)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt prints \"0\" for pytest<6, \"42\" after.\n</description>",

The user is describing that after updating to pytest 6.0, the `caplog` fixture does not restore the log level after a test completes.\n   - In pytest versions before 6.0, when `caplog.set_level(42)` was set in a test, the level would reset to 0 at the end of the test. However, now the level remains at 42.\n\n2. The issue is likely due to the `_finalize` method not functioning properly.\n   - Analyzing the `_finalize` method, it should restore the levels using `_initial_logger_levels` but seems like the restoration is not occurring as expected.\n\n3. Key component to fix:\n   - Ensure `_finalize` correctly tracks and restores the levels after the test.\n   - `set_level` should ensure all state changes are captured properly for later restoration.\n\n4. Expected Result:\n   - After each test that uses `caplog.set_level`, the level should reset to its initial state.\n\n5. Checking related symbols:\n   - `_finalize` method already aims to restore log levels.\n   - `set_level` method should be capturing current levels properly.\n   - Other methods and properties like `handler`, `caplog_handler_key`, `caplog_records_key`, `caplog`, which involve log fetching or setting logic.\n\n6. Fix implementation:\n   - Focus is on `_finalize` and `set_level`.\n   - Verify if `_initial_logger_levels` captures all necessary loggers, including the root, during `set_level`.\n   - Ensure `_finalize` iterates through all necessary loggers and reassigns the original levels effectively.",
