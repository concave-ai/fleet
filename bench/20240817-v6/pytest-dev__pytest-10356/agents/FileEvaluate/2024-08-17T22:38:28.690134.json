    "scratch_pad": "1. Analyze User Instructions:\n   1.1 The user is reporting an issue about pytest markers being lost in certain inheritance cases when multiple classes are involved.\n   1.2 The user provides a reproduction case using a metaclass to work around the issue where normally foo and bar markers wouldn't both apply due to MRO.\n   1.3 The issue is likely caused by the way pytest is handling markers on classes through MRO, which may not account for merging marker attributes from multiple base classes.\n   1.4 The user expects that markers from both base classes (Foo and Bar) should be present, but they're not unless a metaclass is used to modify this behavior.\n   1.5 The proposed solution involves considering MRO and merging marker values, possibly deduplicating them by MRO.\n\n2. Make File evaluation:\n   2.1 `_pytest/skipping.py` is focused on skip/xfail markers, which is related to the management of markers.\n   2.2 Functions and structures related to customization or special handling of markers in the context of skipping and xfail could be involved or need adjustment.\n   2.3 The file primarily documents the process of handling `skip` and `xfail`, and it includes functions for adding options, configuring, and handling tests with these markers.\n   2.4 There is no direct code related to solving an attribute merging issue suggestive of tackling the MRO marker merging here.\n\nConclusion:\nFrom my evaluation, this file seems more focused on handling the skip/xfail functions rather than addressing the core issue of attribute merging during class inheritance. It's not handling `pytestmark` directly for generic pytest markers, and more specifically for class decorators or marker gathering based on MRO.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest this might not be the root cause, but might be relevant for understanding marker-based decisions. The core issue might be elsewhere, such as in the part of pytest which collates marker information during test discovery.",
