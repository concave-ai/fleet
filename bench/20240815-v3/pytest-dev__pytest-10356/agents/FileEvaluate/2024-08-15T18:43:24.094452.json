    "scratch_pad": "The issue at hand discusses the behavior of pytest markers when using multiple inheritance involving classes `Foo` and `Bar`. It states that when inheriting from both classes, one of the markers is lost unless a specific metaclass (`BaseMeta`) is applied. The provided code demonstrates this behavior and includes the implementation of `BaseMeta` and the classes which utilize it.\n\nGiven this context, the file content primarily includes various classes and functions related to pytest fixtures and marker management. However, it doesn't contain the specific classes `Foo` and `Bar`, nor does it contain direct implementations related to the inheritance of markers of these classes. Notably, the `BaseMeta` metaclass is defined within the code snippets but is used in a specific context that doesn't directly relate to the marker application issue as its main role would be tied to fixture handling, not the specific problem reported about losing markers.\n\nTherefore, while the code might indirectly relate to pytest functionality, it does not address the core issue of marker handling in class inheritance scenarios as described. The relevant code discussing the overall marker system seems to be abstracted away correctly in the provided file but particularly lacks focused implementations of the specific message within the issue, leading to my conclusion that it isn\u2019t highly relevant to the reported problem.",
