    "scratch_pad": "The issue reported concerns the behavior of pytest markers when using multiple inheritance, particularly in classes `Foo` and `Bar`. It describes that without a proper implementation (like the metaclass `BaseMeta`), one of the markers would be lost due to the method resolution order (MRO). The relevant code explores how to handle markers correctly using a custom metaclass.\n\nThe provided file `src/_pytest/nodes.py` contains several classes including `Node` which is crucial in the pytest framework for handling test items, their collection and how markers might be handled. However, it does not contain any direct definitions or logic for markers and their resolution that directly affects the issue reported. \n\nThe relevant metaclass for handling markers (like `BaseMeta`) is not part of this provided file, nor is there any mention of handling or merging markers based on class inheritance rules. Therefore, while the behaviors regarding nodes and test execution in this file might relate to the workings of pytest, it does not specifically address the problem outlined in the issue, which revolves around the handling and merging of pytest markers defined in base classes. \n\nThus, this file does not seem to be the root cause of the reported issue but is part of the broader pytest environment. It would be wise to examine files associated with marker handling and management of test collections more closely, especially the files where the classes handling the pytest markers are defined.",
