    "scratch_pad": "1. **Understanding the Issue**:\n   The described issue revolves around the behavior of pytest markers when multiple base classes are used in a derived class. Specifically, markers from both `Foo` and `Bar` are expected to be present for the `TestDings` but only one marker appears due to resolution rules based on MRO (Method Resolution Order).\n\n2. **Cause of the Issue**:\n   The existing implementation of the `pytestmark` property in the `BaseMeta` metaclass is designed to concatenate marks from the class and its MRO. However, it may not properly merge or de-duplicate markers effectively when both base classes assert nearly similar markers.\n\n3. **Expected Behavior**:\n   The ideal expected behavior is for both markers (such as `foo` and `bar`) to be applied to `TestDings` without being overridden by one another.\n\n4. **Expectation**:\n   The expectation should indeed be that when classes with markers are inherited, all their applicable markers are correctly associated with the resulting class.\n\n5. **Solution Needed**:\n   Modify the `pytestmark` implementation to merge markers from multiple base classes rather than replace them. This includes looking into how markers are combined and ensuring that they don't overwrite each other.\n\n6. **Analysis of Symbols**:\n   - **Overall Symbol Count**: Various symbols will be changed mainly in the context of handling the merging of different markers correctly. The current merging strategy applies concat logic in a straightforward way, which may overlook necessary deduplication and application.\n   - **Key Symbols that Require Changes**:\n     - `Mark`: Represents a marker and needs the implementation to allow merging.\n     - `MarkDecorator`: The parent class for various decorators and handles how marks are applied. Its methods like `__call__`, `with_args`, etc. might be instrumental in adjusting the marker application logic.\n     - `combined_with`: This method might need refinement to enhance the merging strategy, ensuring that it appropriately accounts for the presence of identical marker names yet different class sources.\n     - Other decorator classes like `_SkipMarkDecorator`, `_ParametrizeMarkDecorator`, etc. which depend on `MarkDecorator`. They can inherit the changes made and ensure they operate correctly with the modified merging logic.\n\nThe total number of symbols to change in order to fix the issue is approximately 5 significant changes focusing on handling the merging strategy, especially concentrating on `Mark`'s implementation, `MarkDecorator`, and the exact methods described.",

Specifically, markers from both `Foo` and `Bar` are expected to be present for the `TestDings` but only one marker appears due to resolution rules based on MRO (Method Resolution Order).\\n\\n2. **Cause of the Issue**:\\n   The existing implementation of the `pytestmark` property in the `BaseMeta` metaclass is designed to concatenate marks from the class and its MRO. However, it may not properly merge or de-duplicate markers effectively when both base classes assert nearly similar markers.\\n\\n3. **Expected Behavior**:\\n   The ideal expected behavior is for both markers (such as `foo` and `bar`) to be applied to `TestDings` without being overridden by one another.\\n\\n4. **Expectation**:\\n   The expectation should indeed be that when classes with markers are inherited, all their applicable markers are correctly associated with the resulting class.\\n\\n5. **Solution Needed**:\\n   Modify the `pytestmark` implementation to merge markers from multiple base classes rather than replace them. This includes looking into how markers are combined and ensuring that they don't overwrite each other.\\n\\n6. **Analysis of Symbols**:\\n   - **Overall Symbol Count**: Various symbols will be changed mainly in the context of handling the merging of different markers correctly. The current merging strategy applies concat logic in a straightforward way, which may overlook necessary deduplication and application.\\n   - **Key Symbols that Require Changes**:\\n     - `Mark`: Represents a marker and needs the implementation to allow merging.\\n     - `MarkDecorator`: The parent class for various decorators and handles how marks are applied. Its methods like `__call__`, `with_args`, etc. might be instrumental in adjusting the marker application logic.\\n     - `combined_with`: This method might need refinement to enhance the merging strategy, ensuring that it appropriately accounts for the presence of identical marker names yet different class sources.\\n     - Other decorator classes like `_SkipMarkDecorator`, `_ParametrizeMarkDecorator`, etc. which depend on `MarkDecorator`.
