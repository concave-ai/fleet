Analyze User Instructions:\n   1.1 The issue is about pytest markers in two base classes `Foo` and `Bar`, where inheriting from both causes the markers from one class to be lost.\n   1.2 This is caused potentially due to the MRO (Method Resolution Order) and marker attribute handling in pytest.\n   1.3 The expected result is that both markers `foo` and `bar` should be retained in `test_dings` when the class `TestDings` inherits from both `Foo` and `Bar`.\n   1.4 In the absence of an expected result, it should be that both markers are retained.\n   1.5 The issue may require modifying how markers are handled either by modifying how they're attached or how they're merged in multiple inheritance scenarios.\n\n2. Make File Evaluation:\n   2.1 Analyze the entire file content carefully.\n   2.2 Symbols relevant to the reported issue are the Marker creation and adding process, especially around MRO handling, `get_unpacked_marks`, `store_mark`, and potential marker merging functions.\n   2.3 Verify if the comments or methods confirm they are related to controlling/handling/merging markers based on inheritance or MRO.\n   2.4 Thorough review of the marker related functions and how they may resolve markers in inheritance cases.\n   2.5 Check if other parts of the codebase referenced may relate to this logic.\n   2.6 Evaluate if any portion of the codebase here inadequately handles multiple markers due to MRO or other logic evaluate if such portions are the root of the user's issue.\n   \nAfter detailed evaluation, it's obvious that functions handle markers (`get_unpacked_marks`, `store_mark`) and might handle issues around such inheritance conflicts or peculiarities related to multiple resolution handling.\nTherefore, given the described problem in the case, logic around these parts of the file is considered part of the potential solutions or causes since they handle pytest marker assignments and retrievals which would be pertinent to the issue at hand.",

Analyze User Instructions:\\n   1.1 The issue is about pytest markers in two base classes `Foo` and `Bar`, where inheriting from both causes the markers from one class to be lost.\\n   1.2 This is caused potentially due to the MRO (Method Resolution Order) and marker attribute handling in pytest.\\n   1.3 The expected result is that both markers `foo` and `bar` should be retained in `test_dings` when the class `TestDings` inherits from both `Foo` and `Bar`.\\n   1.4 In the absence of an expected result, it should be that both markers are retained.\\n   1.5 The issue may require modifying how markers are handled either by modifying how they're attached or how they're merged in multiple inheritance scenarios.\\n\\n2. Make File Evaluation:\\n   2.1 Analyze the entire file content carefully.\\n   2.2 Symbols relevant to the reported issue are the Marker creation and adding process, especially around MRO handling, `get_unpacked_marks`, `store_mark`, and potential marker merging functions.\\n   2.3 Verify if the comments or methods confirm they are related to controlling/handling/merging markers based on inheritance or MRO.\\n   2.4 Thorough review of the marker related functions and how they may resolve markers in inheritance cases.\\n   2.5 Check if other parts of the codebase referenced may relate to this logic.\\n   2.6 Evaluate if any portion of the codebase here inadequately handles multiple markers due to MRO or other logic evaluate if such portions are the root of the user's issue.\\n   \\nAfter detailed evaluation, it's obvious that functions handle markers (`get_unpacked_marks`, `store_mark`) and might handle issues around such inheritance conflicts or peculiarities related to multiple resolution handling.\\nTherefore, given the described problem in the case, logic around these parts of the file is considered part of the potential solutions or causes since they handle pytest marker assignments and retrievals which would be pertinent to the issue at hand.\",\"relevant\":true,\"root_cause\":false,\"relevant_files\":[\"src/_pytest/nodes.py\",\"src/_pytest/main.py\"],\"relevant_symbols\":[\"get_unpacked_marks\",\"store_mark\"],\"root_cause_symbols\":[]}",

            "scratch_pad": "1. Analyze User Instructions:\n   1.1 The issue is about pytest markers in two base classes `Foo` and `Bar`, where inheriting from both causes the markers from one class to be lost.\n   1.2 This is caused potentially due to the MRO (Method Resolution Order) and marker attribute handling in pytest.\n   1.3 The expected result is that both markers `foo` and `bar` should be retained in `test_dings` when the class `TestDings` inherits from both `Foo` and `Bar`.\n   1.4 In the absence of an expected result, it should be that both markers are retained.\n   1.5 The issue may require modifying how markers are handled either by modifying how they're attached or how they're merged in multiple inheritance scenarios.\n\n2. Make File Evaluation:\n   2.1 Analyze the entire file content carefully.\n   2.2 Symbols relevant to the reported issue are the Marker creation and adding process, especially around MRO handling, `get_unpacked_marks`, `store_mark`, and potential marker merging functions.\n   2.3 Verify if the comments or methods confirm they are related to controlling/handling/merging markers based on inheritance or MRO.\n   2.4 Thorough review of the marker related functions and how they may resolve markers in inheritance cases.\n   2.5 Check if other parts of the codebase referenced may relate to this logic.\n   2.6 Evaluate if any portion of the codebase here inadequately handles multiple markers due to MRO or other logic evaluate if such portions are the root of the user's issue.\n   \nAfter detailed evaluation, it's obvious that functions handle markers (`get_unpacked_marks`, `store_mark`) and might handle issues around such inheritance conflicts or peculiarities related to multiple resolution handling.\nTherefore, given the described problem in the case, logic around these parts of the file is considered part of the potential solutions or causes since they handle pytest marker assignments and retrievals which would be pertinent to the issue at hand.",
