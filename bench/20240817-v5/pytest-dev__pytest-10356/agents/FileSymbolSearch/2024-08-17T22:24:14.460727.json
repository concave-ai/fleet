  "issue": "<description>:Consider MRO when obtaining marks for classes\nWhen using pytest markers in two baseclasses `Foo` and `Bar`, inheriting from both of those baseclasses will lose the markers of one of those classes. This behavior is present in pytest 3-6, and I think it may as well have been intended. I am still filing it as a bug because I am not sure if this edge case was ever explicitly considered.\r\n\r\nIf it is widely understood that all markers are part of a single attribute, I guess you could say that this is just expected behavior as per MRO. However, I'd argue that it would be more intuitive to attempt to merge marker values into one, possibly deduplicating marker names by MRO.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport itertools\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\nclass BaseMeta(type):\r\n    @property\r\n    def pytestmark(self):\r\n        return (\r\n            getattr(self, \"_pytestmark\", []) +\r\n            list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(getattr(x, \"_pytestmark\", []) for x in self.__mro__))\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    @pytestmark.setter\r\n    def pytestmark(self, value):\r\n        self._pytestmark = value\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Base(object):\r\n    # Without this metaclass, foo and bar markers override each other, and test_dings\r\n    # will only have one marker\r\n    # With the metaclass, test_dings will have both\r\n    __metaclass__ = BaseMeta\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.foo\r\nclass Foo(Base):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.bar\r\nclass Bar(Base):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nclass TestDings(Foo, Bar):\r\n    def test_dings(self):\r\n        # This test should have both markers, foo and bar.\r\n        # In practice markers are resolved using MRO (so foo wins), unless the\r\n        # metaclass is applied\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd expect `foo` and `bar` to be markers for `test_dings`, but this only actually is the case with this metaclass.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the repro case is Python 2/3 compatible excluding how metaclasses are added to `Base` (this needs to be taken care of to repro this issue on pytest 6)\nConsider MRO when obtaining marks for classes\nWhen using pytest markers in two baseclasses `Foo` and `Bar`, inheriting from both of those baseclasses will lose the markers of one of those classes.
